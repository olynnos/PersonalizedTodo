# Personalized to do list  

I wanted to do something else than just making a simple ToDoList. So I decided to personalize my project with new functionalities.  

The project uses React.js new Hook method to use states inside a functional component. This is also a great learning experience for me to use React Hooks.

This project might be expanded on later to use local storage or a database. Also might add multiple pages to use React Router and to use either Context api or Redux for global states.
